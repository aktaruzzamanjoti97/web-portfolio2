            <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>
            <p>Hi! Aktaruzzaman Joti here. I first started to learn programming for finding out of curiosity. I started to develop a passion for helping small businesses grow and I wanted to do this by amplifying their online presence. The best way for me to do this, or at least to start, is by building websites for small businesses in my area to really help them grow.</p>
